# About the project
Unitario Engine is a custom C++ game engine built from scratch, this is a project made by a group of 10 university students and its objective is to explore the elements that comprise a game engine as well as the function of each of them.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Platform:** Utilizes SDL2 for cross-platform development, ensuring compatibility on various operating systems.
- **Graphics:** Utilizes the power of Ogre for 3D graphics rendering.
- **Physics:** Incorporates the PhysX physics engine for realistic physics simulations.
- **Audio:** Supports FMOD for high-quality audio playback and sound effects.
- **Scripting:** Employs LUA scripting for flexible scene creation.

## Games Developed

In order to prove that the engine can indeed be used to create video games, two simple projects were developed to demonstrate its capabilities

This is a first-person stealth game in which the player finds themselves inside a dark maze, and their objective is to find the key that allows them to escape. However, the maze is filled with enemies and traps, so the player will have to make use of medkits and switches to navigate through it safely.

This is a top down arcade game where the player faces endless waves of enemies, and the goal is to survive as many rounds as possible. After each wave, the player is offered a series of upgrades for his character to help him during his run.
